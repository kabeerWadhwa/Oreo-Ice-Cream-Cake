First, crush the oreos

Mix all but 2/3 cup of the Oreos with some melted butter. The 2/3 cup crushed Oreos will be reserved for the top of the ice cream cake.

Press the Oreo butter mixture into a 13×9 inch baking dish.

Next, spread the softened cookies ‘n cream ice cream overtop of the crushed Oreos and then place in the freezer for 2-3 hours or until firm.

The next step is to add the warm fudge overtop of the ice cream. Heat up the fudge in the microwave until warm.

Pour the fudge over the ice cream and spread it until it’s in a smooth even layer. The ice cream will melt a little bit due to the warm fudge which is fine. Everything will be frozen eventually. Place the dish back into the freezer for 1 hour.

Once frozen, spread the frozen whipped topping over the fudge and finish it off with the remaining crushed Oreos.
